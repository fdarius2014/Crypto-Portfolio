## Crypto Project Setup

1. Install NodeJs from [NodeJs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Open Terminal
3. Go to your file project
4. Make sure you have installed [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) already. If not, please install.
5. Run in terminal: ```npm install```
6. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

3. Ensure all new folders added are bind with app.module.ts
4. Add routing to `app.routing.ts`
5. In the  `./src/app/components/sidebar/sidebar/`, add routing path to `sidebar.component.ts`
